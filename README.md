# 🎵 CursorCam

> Your music, but make it look _ridiculously_ cool.

Turn any audio into trippy visuals that actually react to your music (not fake, I promise).

## What's This Thing Do?

**10 visual modes** ranging from "zen meditation" to "full cyberpunk chaos"  
**Actually listens** to your music with sub-bass detection at 20-60 Hz  
**Runs in your browser** - no installation, just vibes

## 🚀 Get Started (Super Quick)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mrtracker-new/CursorCam.git
cd CursorCam
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `localhost:3000`, click "Enable Microphone", play music, watch magic happen ✨

**Don't want npm?** Just run `python -m http.server 8000` or `npx serve`

## 🎨 The Modes

- **Minimal Calm** - Meditation vibes (or pretending to meditate)
- **Waveform Spectrum** - Classic frequency bars
- **Particle Energy** - 300 glowing particles that actually make sense
- **Hyperspace Tunnel** - Full 3D wireframe tunnel (peak cyberpunk)
- **Cyberpunk Mode** - Neon geometry, lightning bolts, pure chaos ⚡
- ...and 5 more!

## 🎛️ Controls

| Thing | What It Does |
|-------|--------------|
| Pattern Mode | Switch between all 10 modes |
| Node Density | More = cooler but slower |
| Beat Sensitivity | How wild it gets on drops |
| Color Intensity | Crank the neon |

> Auto-optimizes if your FPS tanks. I got you.

## 🧠 Smart Audio Bits

- Detects **sub-bass** (20-60 Hz), **bass**, **mids**, **highs**
- Beat detection that actually works
- Knows when to chill (silence detection)
- Knows when to GO OFF (climax detection)
- Colors match frequencies: bass = warm 🔥, highs = cool ❄️

## 🛠️ Dev Stuff

```bash
npm run dev       # Dev server
npm run build     # Production build
npm run lint      # Check code
npm test          # Run tests
```

**Stack**: Three.js, Web Audio API, Canvas 2D, pure JS  
**Performance**: 48 FPS average, 60 on 2D modes
